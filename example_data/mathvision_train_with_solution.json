Each edge has 1 smaller cube at each corner, which means there are actually 10 smaller cubes per edge (since the corners are counted twice). Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n\\[ 12 \\times (3-2) = 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\]\n\nThus, the number of smaller cubes with exactly 2 faces painted is 12.\n\nThe final answer is:\n'12'"

Therefore, the total representation should have two lines and two dots.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- (A) has one dot and one line.\n- (B) has one dot and two lines.\n- (C) has two dots and two lines.\n- (D) has three lines.\n- (E) has four lines.\n\nThe correct option that matches our breakdown is (C).\n\n'c'"

We can use Color 1 for one circle, Color 2 for another, and Color 3 for the last two circles (or any permutation of these colors).\n\n5. **Verify the coloring**: After coloring, check that no two adjacent circles share the same color.

Therefore:\n\\[ AB = 20 + 2a \\]\n\nSince the perimeter of the outer square is also composed of four sides of length \\(AB\\), we have:\n\\[ 4AB = 4(s + 2a) = 4(20 + 2a) = 80 + 8a \\]\n\nHowever, we don't need the perimeter of the outer square directly. Instead, we use the relationship \\(a + s = 20\\) to express everything in terms of \\(s\\):\n\\[ AB = s + 2a = s + 2(20 - s) = s + 40 - 2s = 40 - s \\]\n\nBut since \\(AB = s + 2a\\) and \\(a + s = 20\\), we can substitute \\(a = 20 - s\\) into the expression for \\(AB\\):\n\\[ AB = s + 2(20 - s) = s + 40 - 2s = 40 - s \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ AB = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the side length of the outer square is 20 cm. The area of the square is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = AB^2 = 20^2 = 400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of square \\(ABCD\\) is:\n'400'"

This will change the color of that circle and the circles directly touching it (up, down, left, right).\n- **Second Touch**: Touch another circle that hasn't been touched yet. This will change the color of that circle and the circles directly touching it.\n- **Third Touch**: Touch another circle that hasn't been touched yet. This will change the color of that circle and the circles directly touching it.\n- **Fourth Touch**: Touch the last circle that hasn't been touched yet. This will change the color of that circle and the circles directly touching it.\n\nBy following this sequence, we ensure that each circle is touched exactly once, and thus, all circles will be black.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of circles Lucy must touch is 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n'4'"

Therefore, the speed of the train from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\) is \\( \\frac{v}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Meeting Condition:**\n   For the trains to not collide, they must meet within the double-track section where they can pass each other safely. This means the trains must be able to pass each other without stopping.\n\n4. **Distance Calculation:**\n   Let the total distance between \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) be \\( D \\).\n   - Distance covered by the train from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\) in 180 minutes: \\( \\frac{D}{2} \\)\n   - Distance covered by the train from \\( Y \\) to \\( X \\) in 60 minutes: \\( \\frac{D}{v} = \\frac{D}{2} \\)\n\n5. **Double-Track Section:**\n   The double-track section must be such that the trains can pass each other without stopping. This implies that the double-track section should be long enough for both trains to pass through it without collision.\n\nGiven the travel times and speeds, the double-track section must be placed such that it allows the trains to pass each other safely. The correct figure should show the double-track section in the middle of the line.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option (A):** Shows the double-track section at the beginning of the line.\n- **Option (B):** Shows the double-track section in the middle of the line.\n- **Option (C):** Shows the double-track section at the end of the line.\n- **Option (D):** Shows the double-track section near the end of the line but not in the middle.\n- **Option (E):** Shows the double-track section near the beginning of the line but not in the middle.\n\nThe correct option is the one where the double-track section is in the middle of the line, allowing the trains to pass each other safely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n'B'\n\n'B'"

The sum of the first three numbers (10, \\( x \\), \\( y \\)) should be 100.\n2. The sum of the middle three numbers (\\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( z \\)) should be 200.\n3.

This is because the frog must jump over at least one lily pad with each move, and the grid is small enough that a Hamiltonian path (a path that visits each vertex exactly once) is feasible.\n\nThe total number of lily pads in the grid is 16.

However, the angle at the vertex where the angle bisectors meet (the point of intersection of the angle bisectors) has a specific relationship with the original angles of the triangle.\n\n3. **Formula for the Angle at the Vertex of the Angle Bisectors**: The angle formed by the angle bisectors at the vertex is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle at the vertex} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{the measure of the angle opposite to the vertex}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Given Information**:\n   - One of the angles in the triangle is \\(68^\\circ\\).\n   - We need to find the angle at the vertex where the angle bisectors meet.\n\n5. **Applying the Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle at the vertex} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 68^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle at the vertex} = 90^\\circ + 34^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angle at the vertex} = 124^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the size of the angle indicated with a question mark is \\(124^\\circ\\).\n\nThe final answer is: 'B'"

Convert 98 hours and 56 minutes into hours:\n   - 98 hours + 56 minutes = 98 hours + 0.9333 hours (since 56 minutes is 56/60 hours)\n   - Total hours = 98 + 0.9333 = 98.9333 hours\n\n2. Convert 98.9333 hours back into days and hours:\n   - 98.9333 hours = 4 days and 0.9333 hours\n   - 0.9333 hours = 0.9333 * 60 minutes = 56 minutes\n\nSo, Alfonso was underground for 4 days and 56 minutes.\n\n3. Calculate the start time:\n   - If he pulled his head out at 8:15 am on Monday, we need to go back 4 days and 56 minutes.\n   - Going back 4 days from Monday takes us to Thursday.\n   - Subtracting 56 minutes from 8:15 am on Thursday gives us 7:19 am on Thursday.\n\nTherefore, Alfonso buried his head in the sand on Thursday at 7:19 am.\n\nThe correct answer is 'A'."

This sum counts each eel multiple times because each eel is excluded from at least one category.\n   - Since each eel is counted exactly twice (once for each exclusion), the actual number of eels is half of the sum of the exclusions.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of eels:**\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eels in the tank is 21.\n\nThe final answer is:\n'21'"

These squares must contain either 2 or 4 because they differ from 3 by 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Top row:**\n   - The square directly below the 3 must be either 2 or 4.\n     - If it's 2, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n     - If it's 4, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n\n2. **Second row:**\n   - The square directly below the 2 or 4 must be either 1 or 3.\n     - If it's 1, then the square to its right must be 2 or 3.\n     - If it's 3, then the square to its right must be 2 or 4.\n   - The square directly below the 3 or 5 must be either 2 or 4.\n     - If it's 2, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n     - If it's 4, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n\n3. **Third row:**\n   - The square directly below the 1 or 3 must be either 0 or 2.\n     - If it's 0, then the square to its right must be 1 or 2.\n     - If it's 2, then the square to its right must be 1 or 3.\n   - The square directly below the 2 or 4 must be either 1 or 3.\n     - If it's 1, then the square to its right must be 2 or 3.\n     - If it's 3, then the square to its right must be 2 or 4.\n   - The square directly below the 3 or 5 must be either 2 or 4.\n     - If it's 2, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n     - If it's 4, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n\n4. **Fourth row:**\n   - The square directly below the 0 or 2 must be either -1 or 1.\n     - If it's -1, then the square to its right must be 0 or 1.\n     - If it's 1, then the square to its right must be 0 or 2.\n   - The square directly below the 1 or 3 must be either 0 or 2.\n     - If it's 0, then the square to its right must be 1 or 2.\n     - If it's 2, then the square to its right must be 1 or 3.\n   - The square directly below the 2 or 4 must be either 1 or 3.\n     - If it's 1, then the square to its right must be 2 or 3.\n     - If it's 3, then the square to its right must be 2 or 4.\n   - The square directly below the 3 or 5 must be either 2 or 4.\n     - If it's 2, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n     - If it's 4, then the square to its right must be 3 or 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's determine if we can place a 9 in the grid.\n\n### Placing the 9:\n- The only way to reach 9 from 3 is by adding 6 (since 3 + 6 = 9).\n- We need to find a path from 3 to 9 using steps of 1.\n\nBy analyzing the grid, we can see that it is possible to reach 9 by following the rules of the problem. For example, starting from 3, we can move to 4, then to 5, then to 6, and finally to 9.\n\nThus, the possible values in the grid range from 3 to 9.\n\nThe number of different integers used is \\(9 - 3 + 1 = 7\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n'7'"

Let's denote the unknown values as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n2 & 4 & a & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\nb & 3 & 3 & d \\\\\n\\hline\n6 & e & 1 & x \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the first row:\n\\[ 2 + 4 + a + 2 = 8 + a \\]\n\nNext, let's find the sum of the second row:\n\\[ b + 3 + 3 + d = b + d + 6 \\]\n\nAnd the sum of the third row:\n\\[ 6 + e + 1 + x = 7 + e + x \\]\n\nSince all rows must have the same sum, we equate the sums of the first and second rows:\n\\[ 8 + a = b + d + 6 \\]\n\\[ a = b + d - 2 \\]\n\nNow, we equate the sums of the first and third rows:\n\\[ 8 + a = 7 + e + x \\]\n\\[ a = e + x - 1 \\]\n\nWe also equate the sums of the second and third rows:\n\\[ b + d + 6 = 7 + e + x \\]\n\\[ b + d - 1 = e + x \\]\n\nFrom the equations \\(a = b + d - 2\\) and \\(a = e + x - 1\\), we substitute \\(a\\) from the first equation into the second:\n\\[ b + d - 2 = e + x - 1 \\]\n\\[ b + d - e - x = 1 \\]\n\nFrom the equation \\(b + d - 1 = e + x\\), we substitute \\(e + x\\) from this equation into the previous equation:\n\\[ b + d - (b + d - 1) = 1 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 1 \\]\n\nThis confirms our setup. Now, let's use the column sums. The sum of the first column is:\n\\[ 2 + b + 6 = 8 + b \\]\n\nThe sum of the second column is:\n\\[ 4 + 3 + e = 7 + e \\]\n\nThe sum of the third column is:\n\\[ a + 3 + 1 = a + 4 \\]\n\nThe sum of the fourth column is:\n\\[ 2 + d + x \\]\n\nSince all columns must have the same sum, we equate the sums of the first and second columns:\n\\[ 8 + b = 7 + e \\]\n\\[ b = e - 1 \\]\n\nUsing the equation \\(b + d - e - x = 1\\):\n\\[ (e - 1) + d - e - x = 1 \\]\n\\[ d - 1 - x = 1 \\]\n\\[ d - x = 2 \\]\n\\[ d = x + 2 \\]\n\nNow, using the equation \\(a + 4 = 2 + d + x\\):\n\\[ a + 4 = 2 + (x + 2) + x \\]\n\\[ a + 4 = 2 + x + 2 + x \\]\n\\[ a + 4 = 4 + 2x \\]\n\\[ a = 2x \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 2x\\) into \\(a = b + d - 2\\):\n\\[ 2x = b + (x + 2) - 2 \\]\n\\[ 2x = b + x \\]\n\\[ x = b \\]\n\nSince \\(b = e - 1\\) and \\(d = x + 2\\), we substitute back:\n\\[ x = e - 1 \\]\n\\[ d = x + 2 = e \\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 4\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n'4'"
